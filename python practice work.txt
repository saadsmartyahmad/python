whai is python 
python is general purpose high level programminng language
genneral purpose means we can used for web application for destop applicaton game application we can used python.
and python is very sample and easy like c and java 
and the first code of python is 

print("hello world")

this is the first code of python and print is a bulit in function in python provided by python language by using this function we can print anything in consloe and we can take either double code sing le code and tripple code no problem

python is high level programming language means that we are not doing any low level activity in python like were the memory is allocated that why its callec as high level programming language

and the main topic is its a platoform independent language we have to wite one code and used this code at any platform because it produce bytecode write once rum any where

and pyhton is dynamically type programming language 
means we have not declared the type explixity 
like c and java type for example
coding
class Test{
	public static void main(String args []){
		int a=10;
		this is we can decalred type implicity 
		}
}
and like python we are not declared type explicity
python code
a=10;
this is called 
dynamically programming language
and the most important point is we are not compile code expilicity like java
for example 
imaging Test file is there and ther is a class Test then we have to compile code first and then run in java
pracitically example java language
javac Test.java this is the code first we have to complie 
then we have to run code command is 
java Test -----> this is the commad for run code

identifier in python
a name in pyton programming is called identifier like class name variable name and method name for example
a=20
this a is identifier
more example
123_Software its not complie because identifier not start with number
code in python
123_software="software"
print(123_software)
output in python language

File "<string>", line 3
123_software="software"
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal

and the correct vesion is 
software_123="software"
print(software_123)
out will be software 

reserved wor in pythoon 
there are 33 reserved word in python except True False and None all are small letter except this
like import is a keyword if elif else global def True False None for while all are keyword in python

data type in  python 

there are 14 data type in python 
int float str complex bool list tuple set dict byte range all are predefine data type in python mens python give this data type 
and inbuilt funtion in python first type it retun whta typr of data type is it

for example
type()
code 

a=10
print(type(a))
output

<class 'int'>
and ther is another function is there it check the id 
id()
code;;;;
a=10
b=10

print(a is b)
print(id(a))
print(id(b))

output

True
9789280
9789280
another print() function is there the most important funtion by using this we have to print a value

code
print('hello world')
by using this function output will be show in console
hello world output

in bool data type internally bool data type condtain 1 and0
for example
a=True
print(a)
print(type(a))
output
a=True
print(a)
print(type(a))

a=True
print(a)
print(type(a))

and string data type in python 
we can represent string means str data type in double code
for example
a="software"
print(a)
output
software 
more important topic is also there we can represent string str in double quotes even triple code also do and even single code also do
for example coding part


a="software"
b='software'
c='''software'''
print(a,b,c)

output

software software  software
index in str string data type
for example 

s='software solution'
print(len(s))
output
17
code for string data type

s='software'
print(len(s))
print(s[2])
# reverse string logic in python

print(s[-1:-(len(s)+1):-1])

output will be

8
f
erawtfos


type conversion in python
 example and coding for type conversion in python
a="10"
print(int(a))
print(float(a))
print(bool(a))
output

10
10.0
True

Type conversion for float data type 
a="10.0"
print(int(float(a)))
print(float(a))
print(bool(a))
output
10
10
True
List data type list data type in python
In python list is inbuilt data type int python if we want to represent group f object In a single entity then we go for list data type where duplicate value allow insertion order preserved homogenous value allow and growable in nature we can add something or we can remover something 

Practical code for list data type
l=[]
print(type(l))
empty list
output
<class 'list'>
